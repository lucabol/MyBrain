A reference system is a database of books or articles that can be used to retrieve
notes about a book, quickly go the section referred to and create citations/bibliography.

Adding your notes to a reference system allows you quicker access to the most important
parts (for you) of a book.

Annotating a text [takenotes](takenotes.md) can be done at different levels of 'completion'.
What you put in your reference system can either be your original annotations or
a rephrased version.

Arguably, the most used program for this is Zotero.
