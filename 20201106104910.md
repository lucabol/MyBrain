#zettelkasten #learn

Writing something in your own words improves both
understanding and long-term recall (CIT). It is effortful and hence more
memorable. Until we do it, we don't know if we have really understood or just
got comfortable with the material.

Also, writing in pen [[20201106150034]] helps even more.
