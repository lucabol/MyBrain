# 20201106110003 Annotating a Text
#zettelkasten #kindle

You annotate a text as you read it the first time to identify important things.

You can either:
1. Highlight passages:
   1. no flow break, no your words, easy digital extraction.
2. Write in the margin:
   1. medium flow break, your scattered words, hard digital extraction.
3. Write on a separate pad/note:
   1. big flow break, your words, hard digital extraction.

Evidence shows (CIT) that 3. helps recall. Also that 2. helps recall
if structured as 'questions in the margin'.

On a Kindle, reading in bed, 1. is the simplest.
