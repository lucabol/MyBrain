Connections allow insight to emerge when thinking
about different topics.

Connections can be of two kinds:
1. Between permanent notes
2. Between a structure note and a permanent note

You should maximize the former as it is the source of insights.

Some principles to follow are:
. Connect each new note to existing ones.
. Always explain why you made a connection.
